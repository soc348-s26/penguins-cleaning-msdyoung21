# Getting started with data cleaning!

In this repository we will work on:

- getting totally comfortable with R.
- practice reproducible research.
- cleaning data.
- understanding ordinary least squares regression.

Of course, we will also be using github.

You will want to accept the github link.  This will create a repository for you.

Then create a new project "from version control" in R studio, checking out the code from your repository. 

If you have not done so, you will need to create a
PAT (personal access token) for github. You can 
f0llow the instructions here:
